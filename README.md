## Describe your topic/interest in about 150-200 words
The University of Minho and Viticulture Commission of the Vinho Verde Region in Portugal collected 4898 samples of different vinho verdes (wines from Portugal) in 2009. The data includes physicochemical and sensory data about the contents of different wines, but does not include information about identifiable traits of wines such as brand, grape type, or price. 
 
The data is split into two separate datasets: red wine and white wine. The datasets have eleven input (physicochemical) variables: fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulphur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, and alcohol and one output (sensory) variable: quality. The sensory variable is based on human taste preference and is on a rating scale from 0-10. 
 
I speculate that some of the physicochemical variables will have an effect on the quality variable, for example, “white wines with a residual sugar value in between x and y and a fixed acidity greater than z will give a quality of 7 or above 85% of the time.”


## Describe your dataset in about 150-200 words

Since the Kelowna area has several wineries, I am interested in learning more about what characteristics make the best wine. When visiting wineries for a tasting, several of the physicochemical variables are mentioned, so it would be interesting to learn more about how. I would also be interested in seeing how the quality of wine is determined and what factors (high or low sugar, acidity,free sulfur dioxide. etc) will determine the high or low quality of the wine.  

Personally I do not drink alcohol that much but it is very interesting to see what consumers prefer in terms of sweetness or sourness of wine as a product and to think about how this data would be used by companies.. This data may be used for marketing and sales production too for companies that want to aim for a targeted niche market. For companies using a user dashboard, they would be able to adjust their wine taste/quality in correspondence to their target market at the prices in which they find the most profitable.Visually, a user dashboard would help marketers/managers see and understand what to do in terms of quality control and budgeting within their products.
